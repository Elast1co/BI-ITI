# BI-ITI

# 📊 Business Intelligence Learning Project (SQL + Visual Studio)

This is a **BI** work thru ITI where I explored and implemented the core concepts of **Business Intelligence (BI)** using only **Visual Studio** and **SQL** 

The project focuses on the backend side of BI including data extraction, transformation, modeling, and basic analysis logic.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To practice and understand how BI works **under the hood** by applying:

- 🔄 ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- 🧩 Data Integration & Star Schema Design
- 🧮 SQL-Based Data Analysis
- 📁 Manual Data Modeling & Relationship Management

All of this was implemented and organized inside **Visual Studio** as a development environment.

---

## ⚙️ What Was Implemented

- Extracted and loaded sample data from structured files or mock sources
- Cleaned and normalized data using **SQL queries**
- Created a simplified **data warehouse structure** with:
  - Fact Tables (e.g., `FactSales`, `FactStudentCourse`)
  - Dimension Tables (e.g., `DimStudent`, `DimCourse`, `DimDate`)
- Connected data manually using **primary/foreign key relationships**
- Wrote SQL queries to:
  - Calculate KPIs
  - Summarize data by category/date
  - Join and filter data for reporting logic

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

| Tool / Language     | Purpose                                      |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Visual Studio**     | Main development environment                  |
| **SQL Server**        | Data processing and query execution           |
| **T-SQL**             | Data transformation, modeling, and analysis   |
| **Manual Star Schema**| Implemented with SQL scripts (no ORM or GUI) |

> 🔍 No visualization or reporting tools were used in this project — it focuses strictly on **BI fundamentals through backend code**.

## 🧠 Key BI Concepts Practiced

- ETL process from raw tables
- Data normalization & cleaning
- Star schema modeling
- Creating and managing relationships between tables
- Defining calculated fields and KPIs using SQL
- Understanding BI data flows without dashboards
